## One-sentence summary

A concise, reproducible summary of: Characterizing Human Semantic Navigation in Concept Production as Trajectories in Embedding Space

## The "code" angle

Implement the core idea as a minimal simulator; start with a LIF baseline, then add the paper's novelty as a delta.

## Bio-inspiration

Identify which neural signal (rate/timing/synchrony) is assumed to carry information and how learning changes synapses or excitability.
